Certainly! Here’s a detailed explanation structured with headings and subheadings for clarity:

### Operating Systems: Desktop vs. Mobile

#### Desktop Systems
- **Performance-Oriented**: Designed to maximize speed and power for tasks like gaming, design, and data processing.
- **Resource Availability**: Typically have access to a constant power supply and more robust hardware.

#### Mobile Systems
- **Power Efficiency**: Need to balance performance with battery life to ensure the device can be used throughout the day without recharging.
- **Hardware Constraints**: Generally have less powerful hardware that is optimized for energy efficiency.

### The Kernel: Heart of the Operating System

#### Linux Kernel
- **Core Functionality**: Manages system resources and facilitates communication between software and hardware.
- **Universal Design**: Originally created for desktops but adaptable for various other devices, including servers and embedded systems.

#### Android Kernel
- **Google’s Customization**: Modified version of the Linux kernel, optimized for touch interfaces, mobile hardware, and battery management.
- **Focus on Mobile**: Includes additional drivers and power management features suitable for mobile devices.

#### OEM Kernel
- **Manufacturer Customizations**: Further modifications by device manufacturers (like Samsung or Huawei) to optimize for their specific device’s hardware.
- **Hardware-Specific Features**: May include tweaks for better camera performance, screen display optimizations, or unique hardware capabilities.

### Process Scheduling: Managing Tasks

#### Process Scheduler
- **Task Management**: Allocates CPU time to running applications or processes, ensuring that the system remains responsive.

#### Completely Fair Scheduling (CFS)
- **Fairness Principle**: Aims to allocate CPU time equally among all processes to ensure a balanced performance.

### CPU Architectures: Efficiency and Performance

#### Big.LITTLE Configuration
- **Dual Processor Types**: Combines high-performance cores (Big) with energy-efficient cores (LITTLE).
- **Task Allocation**: Assigns tasks based on their intensity - demanding tasks to Big cores and lighter tasks to LITTLE cores to save battery.

### Power Management: Preserving Battery Life

#### Power Consumption
- **Energy Usage**: The amount of power used by the device, which mobile operating systems try to minimize to extend battery life.

#### Foreground vs. Background Processes
- **Prioritization**: The system may give more CPU resources to apps in use (foreground) over apps running in the background.

### Advanced Scheduling: Heterogeneous Multi-Processing (HMP)

#### HMP Technology
- **Combining Core Types**: Allows the use of Big and LITTLE cores at the same time for optimized performance and power usage.
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Can dynamically adjust which cores are used based on the current workload, maximizing efficiency.

In these notes, the focus is on how mobile operating systems, particularly Android, manage resources differently from desktop systems, with an emphasis on power efficiency and responsiveness. The kernel's role is central to this, as it must schedule tasks, manage power, and ensure that the user experience remains smooth, even with the constraints of mobile hardware.

The image contains handwritten notes discussing concepts related to mobile computing, particularly focusing on Android systems. Here's a detailed explanation of each term and concept:

### Heterogeneous Multi-Processing (HMP)

- **Apps in the Foreground**: These are applications currently being used by the user. They are assigned to the 'big' core for better performance due to the higher processing power of these cores.
- **Apps in the Background**: These are applications not currently in active use. They are assigned to the 'LITTLE' core, which is less powerful but more power-efficient, thus conserving battery life.
- **Important Apps**: Sometimes, an app that is running in the background but is important (such as music players or messaging apps) may need more processing power and can be moved to the 'big' core if necessary.

### CPU Affinity

- **By Skipping CPU Affinity**: CPU affinity refers to the scheduling property that binds a process to a given set of CPUs on the system. Skipping CPU affinity means that the system may ignore these settings to optimize performance or power usage.

Resource Environment
Android 13: A version of the Android operating system that likely includes enhanced resource management features.
Tokens: The system assigns "tokens" to apps, which might be a conceptual way of representing the allocation of processing time or resources. When a phone's battery is low, these tokens could be used to determine which processes are allowed to use the 'big' cores and which should be limited to 'LITTLE' cores to save power.
- **Phone's Battery is Charged**: This implies that the resource management strategy might change when the device is charging, possibly allowing more intensive tasks to run on the 'big' cores.

### Power Management

- **Apps Making Unusual Requests**: Some apps may make non-standard requests that disrupt the power management scheme, possibly leading to increased power consumption.
- **Tasks are Deprioritized**: Indicates that some tasks may be given lower priority, which could impact their performance, especially if they are power management tasks.

### Hardware Service Requests

- **HW Service**: Refers to a hardware service like GPS, camera, or Bluetooth. Such services require the hardware to 'wake up' from a low-power state, which consumes more power.
- **Wake Up**: When an app requests a hardware service, the hardware component must exit a standby mode and become active, using additional power.
- **Wakelocks**: A mechanism used by applications to prevent the phone from entering a deep sleep state. If an app holds a wakelock, it can keep certain hardware parts awake and thus consume more battery.

### Memory Management

- **Smaller Memory**: Mobile devices typically have less RAM than desktop computers, which means they have to manage available memory more efficiently.
- **Flash Memory (eMMC or SSD)**: These are types of storage used in mobile devices. eMMC is commonly found in lower-end devices, while SSDs are faster and used in higher-end devices.
- **External Storage (SD Card)**: Refers to additional storage that can be added to a device, often used to store media files.
- **Limited Write Cycles**: Flash memory can only be written to a finite number of times before the risk of failure increases. This is a consideration for the longevity and reliability of the device.

These notes outline some of the challenges and strategies associated with managing computing resources on mobile devices, focusing on Android's use of HMP to balance performance with power consumption. They also touch on memory management and the implications of using flash storage in mobile devices.

The images you've uploaded appear to be a continuation of the handwritten notes discussing Android and programming concepts. Let's go through each term and concept outlined in the notes:

### Image 1: Android Memory Management and Process/Thread Handling

#### Android's Memory Service
- **Extra Service**: Android has a system service that monitors the available RAM.
- **RAM Availability**: If there is insufficient RAM to start new processes, this service will intervene.
- **OOM Killer**: Stands for Out-Of-Memory Killer. It is a mechanism that frees up memory by terminating the least necessary background processes when the system is low on memory.

#### Processes and Threads
- **Integral to Java**: Threads are a fundamental concept in Java, which is used for Android application development.
- **Android Application and Threads**: Android apps utilize threads for multitasking and responsive user interfaces.
- **Linux Processes and Threads**:
  - **Processes**: Each process in Linux (and thus Android) has a unique process identifier (PID).
  - **Threads**: In Linux, threads are treated somewhat like processes but do not each have a unique PID. Instead, they share the PID with the parent process but have their own thread ID (TID).

#### Thread Mapping
- **A New Type of ID**: Threads are given a separate identifier for internal management but share the same PID for the overall process control.

### Image 2: Asynchronous Programming

#### Asynchronous Programming Concept
- **Traditional Programming**: Asynchronous programming is presented as a departure from traditional, linear programming models.
- **Seamless Experience**: The goal of asynchronous programming is to create a user experience without noticeable delays or blocking operations.
- **Input Handling**: It accepts input whenever the user is ready and doesn't block the user from other interactions.
- **Resource-Dependent Processing**: Processing begins when resources are available and does not necessarily have to complete before the next operation can start.
- **Signal-Driven**: Utilizes signals to manage the execution flow. For example, when input arrives, a signal might be sent to trigger a specific function within the application.

#### Programming Languages and Asynchronous Support
- **JavaScript/Kotlin**: These languages are mentioned as being supportive of asynchronous programming paradigms.
- **Android's Evolution**: Notes that Android has moved towards supporting asynchronous programming more in the last 4-5 years.

#### Drawbacks of Asynchronous Programming
- **Visualization for Developers**: It may be harder for developers to visualize the flow of asynchronous programs.
- **Debugging Challenges**: Asynchronous programming can make debugging more complex due to the non-linear execution flow.

In summary, the notes discuss how Android manages its processes and threads, especially in low-memory situations, and how it aligns with Linux's handling of processes and threads. They also touch on asynchronous programming, highlighting its benefits for user experience and its challenges for development and debugging.
The text from the image seems to suggest that Android attempts to address a particular issue by using various methods of handling sensor input. Here's what this likely means in more detail:

### Android and Sensor Input Handling

- **Sensor Input**: Mobile devices are equipped with various sensors that provide data about the environment, user interaction, and device orientation, among other things.
- **Mitigating Problems**: The problems could refer to issues such as sensor noise, conflicting sensor data, or the high power consumption associated with continuous sensor monitoring.
- **Different Ways of Handling**: This implies that Android uses multiple strategies to process sensor input effectively. These could include:

  - **Sensor Fusion**: Combining data from multiple sensors to improve accuracy and reliability of the information.
  
  - **Thresholding**: Setting certain thresholds to ignore insignificant changes in sensor readings to prevent false triggers.
  
  - **Batching**: Collecting sensor data in batches to reduce the frequency of wake-up calls needed to process the data, which can save power.
  
  - **Sensor Calibration**: Regularly calibrating sensors to maintain the accuracy of their readings.

- **Efficient Use**: By using these techniques, Android aims to ensure that sensor data is used efficiently, minimizing battery usage while providing accurate and timely information to applications.

The note succinctly points out that Android has mechanisms to manage sensor input intelligently, likely to enhance user experience and system performance.
